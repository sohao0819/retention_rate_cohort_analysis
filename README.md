# Retention Rate Cohort Analysis

The goal of this project is to perform cohort analysis to understand engagement and retention of an app's users. More specifically, it is intented to answer the following questions:
- Which factors are associated with better engagement/retention?
- What segments are doing well and what could be improved?
- What are the recommendations (business initiatives or product changes) to address these opportunties?
- What other research, experiments, or approaches could help the company get more clarity on the problem?

**Data:**
- **users.csv**: a user table with data on users who joined between January and August 2019.
- **user_activity**: a usage summary table that has a row for each day a user logged into the product.
